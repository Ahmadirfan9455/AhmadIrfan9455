### 🚀 My Projects & Contributions

Check out some of my most recent and notable projects:

- **[Aamozish (Flutter)](#)** – A language learning app built with Flutter, focused on Arabic and Persian. Utilizes Firebase for real-time data storage and user management.
- **[Stochastic Modeling (Python)](#)** – A Python + Flask project for simulating stochastic systems like Markov Chains, Hidden Markov Models, and M/M/1 queues. Includes REST APIs for probabilistic analysis and state predictions.

> 🐍 I often use **Python** for quick scripting, solving DSA problems, and backend microservices.
